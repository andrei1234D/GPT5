Verifier note: "Confirming BrainScore as BASE. RSI_14 at ~29.93 indicates oversold/weak momentum; Volatility_30D elevated (1.595) vs 252D (0.981) suggests near-term chop; pos_30d=1.0 and multi-window momentum (>1 on 63/126/252D) are supportive but not enough without a catalyst. News Impact: 0. No adjustment warranted."
