Verifier note: Strong multi-horizon momentum (63D/126D/252D all positive) and price near 30D/52W highs (pos_30d/pos_52w ≈1) support the BrainScore; RSI14 ~59 is constructive but not overbought. Very elevated 30D volatility (3.05) indicates higher risk and potential for pullback; no news catalyst (Impact: 0). Metrics align with a moderate score; no adjustment. No external sources used.
