What reduced the score: Elevated 30D volatility vs 252D; no news catalyst; BASE well below buy threshold despite neutral RSI and positive 30D/52W positioning

Verifier note: Confirmed BrainScore (using pred_score as BrainScore). Metrics show improving momentum (63D/126D), positive pos_30d and pos_52w, and neutral RSI_14 (~57.6), but significantly higher recent volatility raises risk and there’s no news catalyst; no adjustment warranted.
