Verifier note: Confirmed BrainScore. Momentum short/intermediate-term >1 (63D/126D) and positive news help, but RSI_14 is extreme (85.79), pos_30d is very extended (~0.97), 30D volatility is elevated (~0.34), and 252D momentum <1—suggesting near-term overbought risk. No adjustment to BASE warranted.
