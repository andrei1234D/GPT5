What reduced the score: Overextended vs FVA (~32% above anchor), ultra-low liquidity (Vol_vs_20d -85%), very high volatility (ATR%/risk proxies), negative FCF/OP efficiency proxies.
What wasn't clear or contradictory: Exceptional PEG with micro-cap-like volatility; momentum mixed (RSI>60 but 5d% -7.4%, tiny MACD_hist); no forward growth data.
