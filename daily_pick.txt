What reduced the score: Very high 30D volatility vs 252D; no news catalyst; RSI_14 ~58 (not a strong edge); BASE well below buy thresholds despite positive momentum.
Verifier note: Confirmed BrainScore; positives (Momentum_63D/126D/252D all strong, pos_30d>0, pos_52w high) are offset by elevated short-term volatility and lack of catalysts—no adjustment warranted.
