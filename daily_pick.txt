Verifier note: Treating pred_score as BrainScore. Metrics show solid medium- to long-term momentum (Momentum_63D/126D/252D all positive), RSI_14 ~57 (not overbought), and strong positioning (pos_30d ~0.68, pos_52w ~0.80). However, 30D volatility is elevated vs 252D (1.66 vs 0.92), and there is no news catalyst. These support a sub-buy BASE and I confirm the BrainScore with no adjustment.
