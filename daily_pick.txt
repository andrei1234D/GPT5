What reduced the score: Negative MACD_hist and Momentum, elevated ATR%/volatility, small-cap risk, no supportive news
Verifier note: Confirmed BrainScore; uptrend signals (RSI>60, EMA50>EMA200, positive 30d position) are offset by weak momentum (MACD_hist<0, Momentum<0) and high ATR%, so no adjustment warranted.
