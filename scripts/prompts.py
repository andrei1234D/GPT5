    "SCORING (BASE ONLY, 0–1000):\n"
      "You are given CURRENT_PRICE and technical/fundamental indicators.\n"
    "First, compute a single FAIR_VALUE_ANCHOR ($FVA) for TODAY.\n"
    "- Start from the provided FVA_HINT if available; adjust it only if indicators clearly support it.\n"
    "- Ensure $FVA is plausible: clamp it to ±15% of CURRENT_PRICE unless strong data supports more.\n"
    "- Use EXPECTED_VOLATILITY_PCT (from ATRpct) for level calculations.\n"
    "  • Let EV = EXPECTED_VOLATILITY_PCT, with floor at 1.0% and cap at 6.0%.\n"
    "  • Buy range = FVA × (1 − 0.8×EV/100) … FVA × (1 + 0.8×EV/100)\n"
    "  • Stop loss = FVA × (1 − 2.0×EV/100)\n"
    "  • Profit target = FVA × (1 + 3.0×EV/100)\n"
    "- Sanity rules:\n"
    "  • If stop ≥ buy_low after rounding, push stop down to min(buy_low × 0.99, FVA × (1 − 2.2×EV/100)).\n"
    "  • If target ≤ buy_high, push target up to max(buy_high × 1.05, FVA × (1 + 3.2×EV/100)).\n"
    "- All $ values: round to 2 decimals, output in 'Buy X–Y; Stop Z; Target T; (Anchor: $FVA)' format.\n"
    "- If FUNDAMENTALS_COVERAGE ≤ 2 AND catalysts are technical-only, cap the FINAL BASE score at 700.\n"
    "- Never fabricate data; if something is missing, leave it out or mark N/A.\n"
"GENERAL RULES:\n"
"- Each category starts at a NEUTRAL baseline. Missing/ambiguous data ⇒ keep baseline (do NOT assume worst case).\n"
"- Tie-break: higher Catalysts, then higher Fundamentals.\n"

"WEIGHTS (v2):\n"
"1) Market & Sector (0–300)  Baseline: 150\n"

"   • Sector momentum: +10…+40 / −10…−40\n"
"   • Relative strength: +10…+40 / −10…−40\n"
"   • Breadth/volume: +5…+30 / −5…−30\n"
"\n"
"2) Fundamentals (0–300)  Baseline: 150\n"
"   • Rev/EPS growth (REV_GROWTH_YOY, EPS_GROWTH_YOY): +8…+60 / −8…−60\n"
"   • Margin trend (GROSS_MARGIN, OPER_MARGIN): +6…+45 / −6…−45\n"

"   • Balance sheet (DEBT_TO_EBITDA, NET_CASH): +5…+30 / −5…−30\n"
"   • Op efficiency (OP_EFF_TREND): +5…+20 / −5…−20\n"
"\n"
"3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–200)  Baseline: 100\n"
"   (unchanged rules + timing multiplier)\n"
"\n"
"4) Valuation (0–150)  Baseline: 75\n"
"   • Discount vs peers/history (PE vs PE_SECTOR or VALUATION_HISTORY): +10…+45 / −10…−45\n"
"   • FCF yield/PEG/EV/EBITDA/PS mix: +8…+35 / −8…−35\n"
"\n"
"5) Risks (0–50)  Baseline: 50 then deduct\n"
"   • Regulatory/competition/macro/concentration/governance: −5…−20 each (as applicable)\n"
"\n"
"GUARDRAILS (coverage-aware; still neutral on missing data):\n"
"- Compute FUNDAMENTALS_COVERAGE = count of present fields among {REV_GROWTH_YOY, EPS_GROWTH_YOY, GROSS_MARGIN, OPER_MARGIN, FCF_MARGIN, DEBT_TO_EBITDA, NET_CASH, OP_EFF_TREND}.\n"
"- If FUNDAMENTALS_COVERAGE ≤ 2 AND Catalysts are technical-only, cap the FINAL BASE at 800.\n"
"- If FUNDAMENTALS_COVERAGE ≥ 5, allow Fundamentals category to use the TOP HALF of its ranges (i.e., +/− levels 3–5 when warranted).\n"
"- If VALUATION fields present ≥ 3, allow Valuation to use TOP HALF of its ranges.\n"
"\n"
"BASE = sum of categories (clamped per category), cap at 1000.\n"

"FUNDAMENTALS FIELD MAPPING:\n"
"- If EPS_GROWTH_YOY and REV_GROWTH_YOY are both ≥10% and stable/accelerating → higher levels on growth factor.\n"
"- Margin/FCF factors use GROSS_MARGIN, OPER_MARGIN, FCF_MARGIN and their trend (OP_EFF_TREND).\n"
"- Balance sheet uses DEBT_TO_EBITDA (≤1.5 = strong; ≥3.0 = weak) and NET_CASH (true boosts).\n"
"- Guidance credibility uses GUIDANCE_CHANGE (Up/Flat/Down) and consistency across recent periods.\n"
"- If a field is missing → treat that sub-factor as NEUTRAL (0 adjustment from baseline).\n"
"\n"
"VALUATION FIELD MAPPING:\n"
"- Relative PE: compare PE to PE_SECTOR; 15–25% discount with intact growth → positive levels; 15–25% premium without growth → negative levels.\n"
"- EV/EBITDA and PS vs sector medians guide additional ± levels; FCF_YIELD ≥5–7% is positive; PEG ≤1.5 is positive, ≥2.5 negative.\n"
"- Missing valuation fields → NEUTRAL (keep baseline 50).\n"
