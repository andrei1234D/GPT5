TODAY is Nov 26. You are given up to 10 pre-filtered stock candidates. Each candidate is a CSV row with header: TickerName,Ticker,BrainScore,current_price,RSI14,MACD_hist,Momentum,ATRpct,volatility_30,pos_30d,EMA50,EMA200,MarketTrend,News.

Important: the numerical metrics in the CSV are the authoritative, latest values and must be treated as primary. You may consult at most 2 external reputable sources per pick for additional context or metrics not present in the CSV, but treat such external metrics as lower-confidence and limit adjustments based on them to ±10% of the BASE.

Your job: verify the BrainScore — confirm it or suggest a small adjustment (maximum ±10%). Explain your rationale, provide a Certainty (0–100%), and output the VERIFIER_DECISION using the exact code blocks.
