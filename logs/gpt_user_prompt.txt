TODAY is Nov 26. You are given up to 10 pre-filtered stock candidates. Each candidate includes a BrainScore (0–1000), a handful of core technical metrics, optional valuation hints, and a very short news snippet.

Use BrainScore as the primary ranking signal and use the metrics only to refine the score, highlight risks, and assign ADVICE (Strong Buy / Buy / Hold / N/A).

If more than one stock meets the ≥720 point system, return ALL of them. If none meet that level, return only the single highest-scoring pick.
